join types - 
    one to one
    one to many
    many to many

for each type -
    modify select - row number column naming etc
    modify rowsToJson - build sub json etc

rowsToJson -> SqlParser

make relation into a generic, implementation for each join type 
    - what to do with the leftmost table?
